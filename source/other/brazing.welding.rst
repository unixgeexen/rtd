Brazing
--------
Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Joining metal items by melting and flowing a filler between the items.  The filler has a lower melting point than the other metals
* Different metals can be joined
* Wetting - filler metal flows over the other metal when melted
	* capillary action
* The items being joined must be very clean
* There are many brazing techniqes - efficient heating, joint geometry

Components
^^^^^^^^^^
* Filler materials - many options
	* `Filler selection chart <https://www.weldclass.com.au/blog/81-selection-chart-welding-brazing-rods>`_
	* Filler selection
		* melting range
		* materials to be joined
			* Cu-Zn (Brass) - for steel
			* Al - for aluminium
			* Ni - stainless steel
* Flux - for home environments, prevent oxides forming when metals heated, cleans surfaces
	* Choice mainly depends on metals being joined
* Combined Filler/Flux available as a paste
* Post braze generally requires cleaning - boiling water or nitric acid/water rinse
* `Brazing Temperatures <https://www.dodomachine.com/brazing-temperature-the-ultimate-guide-for-stronger-joints/>`_
	* Higher Brazing temperature gives greater tensile strength

Tools
^^^^^
* `Torch Brazing <https://www.muggyweld.com/2021/05/24/best-torch-brazing-soldering/>`_
* `Best torches for Brazing/Soldering <https://www.muggyweld.com/2021/05/24/best-torch-brazing-soldering/>`_
	* Bernzomatic is best all-round brazing setup

Types of Metals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Steel brazing

Brazing Steps
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `Lucas Milhaupt Steps <https://lucasmilhaupt.com/EN/Brazing-Academy/Brazing-Fundamentals.htm>`_

1. Good and Proper Fit - capillary action, great joint strength 0.025-0.127mm
	1. Just sitting parts of top of each other is good enough
2. Cleaning the Metals
	1. remove grease/oil - degreaser
	2. remove oxide scale - mechanical, acid
3. Fluxing the parts - prevents oxides forming, promotes wetting, brush on paste
4. Assembly for brazing - gravity is simplest
5. Brazing the Assembly
	1. Heating methods
	2. Depositing Filler Materials - add flux to filler tip, filler material tends to flow towards hotter areas
6. Cleaning the Joint - flux removal is essential, simplest methods quench in 50C+ water as soon as joints have solidified, light wire brushing is OK
