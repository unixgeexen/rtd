* `Airbrake notes <https://airbrake.io/blog/design-patterns/object-oriented-analysis-and-design>`_
* object - instance of thing representing a real world object with
   * properties - characteristics
   * methods - behaviours
   * states - data  
* analysis process - model functional requirements, ignoring implementation requirements
   * find and define objects
   * organise objects
   * describe object interactions
   * define external behaviour of objects
   * define internal behaviour of objects  
* process
   * implementation and constraints of object from analysis
   * from OOA concepts to OOD implementation
   * from ``what`` to ``how``
* example process from airbrake
   * use case model - use case diagram - identify actors and major events initiated by actors
   * systems analysis
      * activity diagram - major activities from use case
      * sequence diagram - sequence of activities and timing
   * analysis phase
      * class diagrams - use case nouns starting point, group as appropriate
      * statechart diagrams - understand complex processes - potentially modify classes
   * systems design - modify UML diagrams and completed specifications - classes, attributes, methods
   * Develop and document
